## TL;DR

About one third of new products turn out to be unprofitable. It can be caused by  many reasons â€“ poor product, high price, wrong timing, big competition, etc.

## Why Do Some Products Fail? 

#### Poor Product Quality

Of course, poor quality products are not successful.

#### High Price

Higher production and distribution costs can cause a product's higher price. It will be difficult to sell such a product to middle- and lower-income buyers.

#### Wrong Timing

In the case the product is introduced at an unsuitable time, it can easily fail. It is important to choose the correct time for its promotion.

#### Inherent Defect

Possible inherent defects can disqualify the product and turn it to be a failure. Buyers can avoid the product even if the defect is fixed later. 

#### Big Competition

In the case there are many similar products, the buyer will have many alternatives. In such a condition, the product can be unsuccessful.

#### Lack of Promotion

It is very important to promote the product especially in the introduction stage. If the appropriate promotion is neglected, the product can easily fail.

#### Poor Support

The support quality is another important thing. Non-existent or poor support can ruin the product's reputation. 

#### Failure to Understand Consumer Needs and Wants

Blinded by their own visions, some companies ignore negative user feedback. Their products can easily fail to meet customers' needs and wants.

## Zune Story

Microsoft introduced its portable media player in 2006. From the very beginning, Zune faced these challenges: 

- inevitable comparisons to iPod 
- its software was only available for Windows. 

In December 2008, Microsoft said Zune revenues had decreased by 54%, or $100 million. 

Microsoft admits that they were just chasing Apple with a product that offered no reasons for customers to switch.
