# Unsuccessful Product

## TL;DR

About 30 to 45% of new products fail to deliver any meaningful financial return. This typically happens due to a number of reasons â€“ poor product / market fit, high price, failure to understand customer needs, fixing a non-existing problem, etc. 

## Why Do Some Products Fail? 

#### Poor Product Quality

Obviously, a product, which is of poor quality, cannot be sold.

#### Higher Price

Another reason for the failure of certain products is the price factor. Higher production and distribution costs may lead to a higher price. Such a product cannot be sold in a market consisting of buyers willing to pay only lower range prices.

#### Poor Timing

It is important that a product (to be successful) is introduced in the market at the correct time. If it is introduced at an unsuitable time it may turn out to be a failure.

#### Inherent Defect

There may be an inherent defect in the product, which may affect its market potentialities. Such a product may not be preferred by the buyers even if the defect is fixed later.

#### Big Competition

In the case there are many similar products, the buyer will have many alternatives. In such a condition, the product can be unsuccessful.

#### Lack of Promotional

Popularizing the brand, particularly, in the introduction stage of a product is essential. Such a step will ensure repeated buying and bring long-term benefits. Failure to do so will be disastrous for the product.

#### Poor Support

The support quality is another important thing. Non-existent or poor support can ruin the product's reputation. 

#### Failure to Understand Consumer Needs and Wants

Blinded by their own visions, some companies ignore negative user feedback. Their products can easily fail to meet customers' needs and wants.

## Zune Story

Microsoft first introduced this portable media player in 2006, with several new generations of the device to follow. Zune faced these major challenges: 

- inevitable comparisons to the iPod, which ruled the portable media marketplace 
- the fact that its software was only available for Windows. 

In a financial report covering the fiscal quarter ending in December 2008, Microsoft said Zune revenues had decreased by 54%, or $100 million. 

Microsoft admits that they were just chasing Apple and created a product that offered no reasons for customers to switch.
