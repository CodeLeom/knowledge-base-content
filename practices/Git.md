# Git 

**TL;DR**

Git is a distibuted version control system (VCS) tools used for tracking code in a software development project.

## What Is a Git?

Git is one of many VCS that are there in the market but it simply is the most popular among the developers. It allows flawless management for large and small projects. The basic difference between git and other VCS is mainly the way they store their files. Generally, VCS other than Git store files in the form of a list as file-based changes (this is known as delta-version control system). 
But Git on the other saves the data in the form of snapshots of the file-system. Whenever you commit some changes to the project it will take the snapshot and save it with a reference and for efficiency, it does not take the snapshot if the file is not changed it just links it to the previous ones.
It was created by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) in 2005 for the development of [Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel).


## How does it work?

Git is a lot more complicated than it looks at its front end command line. Let's have a look at it.

#### Data Model

When a repository is created and some changes are made and committed. Git generates a 40-Character checksum (SHA1) hash. These hashes are created for every object and the first two characters of the checksum are for the directory name and the rest of them are for the file name. 
There are three types of objects created by git. First, is **blob** object which stores the snapshot of the files that we committed (there can n objects for n committed files). Second, it creates **tree** object which contains the list of all committed files having a pointer to blob objects. The third and final object is the **commit** object that has the pointer to the tree object.

#### Branching

It is an independent line of development for a particular project having its commits. So how does git does the branching? For a layman, it looks like a list of commits but it is not exactly how it works. Git only keeps the track of the latest commit on a branch that can easily be used to reconstruct the whole commit list. It then used a pointer named **head** which has reference to the checkout branch and it is also used for tracking.

#### Index

According to the git's point of view, it has mainly three areas: **Working directory, staging area, and the repository**. When we work on a project on our local machine, it is stored in your computer's filesystem which can be called **working directory**. The changes that are made to the project will remain in the working directory unless we add them to the staging area using the `git add` command. The staging area can be described as the initial state of the new commit. The staging area can be used to fine-tune the commits by adding or removing until it suits you, after which you can do `git commit` to save it to the directory as an object. For this process, git doesn't use any directory but on the other hand, it uses **index** which can be used to track changes.



## Why git is preferred

- Git is much faster than Subversion.
- Git's repositories are much smaller than Subversions.
- Git was designed to be fully distributed from the start, allowing each developer to have full local control.
- Git branches are simpler and less resource heavy than Subversion's.
- Git branches carry their entire history.
- Git provides better auditing of branch and merge events
- Git's repo file formats are simple, so repair is easy and corruption is rare.
- Git repository clones act as full repository backups.



## Basics of using git
There are a lot of ways that you can start. For your guidance, I have compiled which I call a noob guide to start with git.ðŸ™‚

You can start by following these steps:

1. First, download git. For windows, you can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). For Linux use this command `sudo apt-get update $ sudo apt-get install git`. For MAC you can download it from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/).
2. Create an empty repository by using the `git init` command or you can checkout a repository by `git clone /path/to/repository` command while using a remote server you can use `git clone username@host:/path/to/repository`.
3. Now make the changes in the repository according to your need. (This step will follow the workflow that was discussed above)
4. The changes made by you can be proposed (add to **INDEX**) using `git add <filename>`.
5. To commit these changes you can use `git commit -m "Commit message"`.
6. Now the changes that you have made are in the **head** to send it to the remote repository use `git push origin master`. If you have not cloned the repository you can use `git remote add origin <server>`.
7.If you want to add a feature to your project but don't want to disturb the original project you can make a branch out of the main project by using `git checkout -b feature_x` command. You can switch to the original project by using the `git checkout master` command. Remember unless you push the branch using `git push origin <branch>` it will not be publicly available.


Hurrayy!! you created your first branch commit with knowing what exactly goes in the backend.ðŸŽ‰

## Some Pitfalls of the Git 

- User interface maturity
- Single repository
- Access controls
- Binary Files.
