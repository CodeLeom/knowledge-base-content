# Software Development Kit (SDK)

**TL;DR**

It is a set of toolchains that allow a developer to write applications for a given platform or allow them to use a specific framework to do so. You have what you need to get the job done, and what's included in your kit toolbox, varies from platform to platform.

## What is an SDK

A Software Development Kit (SDK) is the toolbox of the software development world. But instead of tools like screwdrivers and pliers, SDKs contain libraries and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that make it easier to create applications for specific software and/or hardware.

It can also be thought of as a wrapper library developed by a service provider which provides an abstraction around the services or capabilites that the platform has or supports.

### Why You Might Want an SDK

An SDK can include a range of things, including libraries, documentation, code samples, processes, and guides that developers can use and integrate into their applicatios. SDKs are designed to be used for specific platforms or programming languages.

All of this is done through the libraries included in each SDK. A library is essentially a piece of software that allows your application to communicate with the specific platform it is running on. Tools for debugging, compilation and relevant documentation are often included in SDKs, which makes it easy for developers to fix or extend their application.

SDKs provide developers with an array of tools needed to provide users of their application a standardized interface. Developers do not need to reinvent the wheel when it comes to standard application features. SDKs have a set of robust functionality - error handling, consistent performance, code reuse - that takes a lot of the complexity away for the application software developers.



## Problems an SDK Solves

- Risk mitigation
- [Meaningless work](/problems/meaningless-work)
- Faster deployment
- Shorter development cycle

## Common Pitfalls of an SDK

- Tracing bugs and errors might be difficult if the SDK is not extensively documented.
- The SDK needs to be written and maintained for each supported functionality or service.
- The SDK needs to be implemented in every programming language which you want to support.
- Third-party SDKs might require special permissions which you may not want to support.
- There can be licensing issues if the licensing terms for your application and the SDK differ.
