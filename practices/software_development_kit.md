# Software Development Kit (SDK)

**TL;DR**

It is a set of toolchains that allow a developer to write applications for a given platform or allow them to use a specific framework to do so. You have what you need to get the job done, and what's included in your kit toolbox, varies from platform to platform.

## What is an SDK

A Software Development Kit (SDK) is the toolbox of the software development world. But instead of tools like screwdrivers and pliers, SDKs contain libraries and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that make it easier to create applications for specific software and/or hardware.

It can also be thought of as a wrapper library developed by a service provider which provides an abstraction around the services or capabilites that the platform has or supports.

There are notable differences between an API and an SDK. An API is an interface to a service that you might provide to the developers who want to build applications revolving around the service. They are designed to be used to communicate between applications. You ideally provide an API for each service that should be accessible and the relevant documentation.

The SDK serves as a structured package which provides an abstraction for the APIs to ensure consistent usage on a particular platform and allow the developer to easily create applications which use the APIs. An API does not include an SDK, however, an SDK might contain various APIs.

### Why You Might Want an SDK

A Software Development Kit may be delivered with relevant software libraries, technical documentation, code-snippets, specialized application software, such as compilers, interpretors, debuggers, and tools that developers can use to build applications.

An SDK is designed to be used to create or extend their applications built on a specific platform or programming language. Developers might have to develop their logic and use their tools to interface with services.

Therefore, it is useful to develop an SDK when you want to package standardized interfacing to multiple services to the developers to reuse without needing them to improvise to access the services.

## How to Implement an SDK

**Keep it Simple and Intuitive**

Keep the codebase simple and straightforward will allow more users to adopt the SDK. Intuitive method signatures and abstractions help the users in utilising the SDK effectively.

If an user is familiar with the language and the platform, they should be able to start using the SDK within a short period. Classes and methods accessible to the user should have intuitive parameters relevant to the function they are expected to perform.

The SDK should follow the standard design patterns for the platform and language they are meant to be used for. Non-standard patterns and complex abstractions can make it confusing to the user and they might end up not using the SDK.

**Keep it Up-to-date**

Use a consistent code style to avoid confusion for future developers and users. The documentation and changelog should be updated after every change to the codebase. Use [Semantic Versioning](/practices/semantic-versioning) to maintain and track releases.

As features are added and removed, the codebase should be cleaned up from time to time. Deprecated code should be pruned and security vulnerabilities should be addressed regularly. If the SDK has dependencies or prerequisites, consider security updates and apply them.

**Have Good Documentation**

Proper documentation of the various parts of the SDK is essential for the users to use the SDK. The documentation should explain the usage of the included libraries, classes, and also contain sample code that can be used by the user to familiarize themselves with the SDK. All edge cases should be documented and there should be little to no scope of guesswork on the part of the user.

If the SDK bundles an API, it is important to document and provide insight on how the calls to interfaces are made and what processes can be overriden. The documentation should be written keeping all levels of audience in mind and use of excessive technical jargon should be minimized.

**Make the SDK Accessible**

The SDK should practically be available for users to obtain and start developing using the tools it contains. Use an accessible repository for supported languaged to distrubute the SDK or have a file storage or distribution facility in place. The documentation should also be easily available. If the SDK is open-source, host the source code that is accessible to the public to allow collaboration and community contribution.

## Common Pitfalls of an SDK

- Tracing bugs and errors might be difficult if the SDK is not extensively documented.
- The SDK needs to be written and maintained for each supported functionality or service.
- The SDK needs to be implemented in every programming language which you want to support.
- Third-party libraries in SDKs might require special permissions which you may not want to support.
- There can be licensing issues if the licensing terms for your application and the SDK differ.
