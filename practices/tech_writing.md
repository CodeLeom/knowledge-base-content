# Technical Writing

**TL;DR** Tech Writing is the practice of documenting software, hardware, or process to make the work easier through welcoming colaboration, both external and internal. As Tech Writer, you manage knowledge and information in your team.

## What Is Technical Writing 

Technical writing (sometimes written as tech writing) at its base is a process of information and knowledge sharing. Since you are not the only person working on A with only your handcreated tools, everything today requires enough information. *New library in your project? What does this function does again? How can we fetch this resource?* Do these questions sound familiar? In the team, you would go to the person who wrote questioned software and be like *Hey, Prokop, how do it do this?*. But teams get bigger and more remote. The person who wrote that pieceof code is probably working on something else (and can be living 20 hours away from you). Synchronity becomes problem. You need your answer now, or the project burns money. It is frustrating to sit and wait for just enough information. 

If everyone worked like that, nothing would ever be done. The knowledge debt would creep back and back. So, how to fix this? You can turn the single person resource into multiple people. Somebody probably worked with that code, so you don't need to ask Prokop, you can ask Ad√©la. But time is ticking. She is also working on something important right now. So what now? That is when technical writing comes to rescue.

The text itself is asynchronous. Well-documented software answers almost all queston leaving friction and frustration at bay. Text can be anywhere in the world, at the same time. It doesn't work on somethng else.

Technical writer facilitates this process of technical sharing. Their work is to enable collaboration. A skilled tech writer goes even further. They design how to share the information. They entangle a mess, find what is relevant and share it. Imagine working with completely new tool on completely new project. The ammount of stuff uknown is frightening. Techwriters [job](/practices/jtbd) is to help you from the zero-point to the hero point. You don't need all details from start. In fact, too much information can overload you and demotivate you. 
  
## Why You Might Want Technical Writing 

Usually, Technical writing is generally understood through [Documentation](/practices/documentationes). In short, documentation is a tool that simplifies information sharing. Tech Writer is the one who is responsible to create documentation. They keep information up to day, are responsible for content quality (see [Documentation testing](/practices/documentation-testing)). A good documentation makes your product better.

But that is not all Tech writing can do. Together with UX team he can help with Labeling, Descriptions and more. If you have experienced TW, their insight can improve your [UX strategy](/practices/ux-strategy). Tech writers should know how people learn which is always viable for newcommers. 

Good tech writer learns about information. They look how to communicate effectively with readers. Having their inside while designing can increase the chance of an uccessful product. They can interview. They know where to get what they need.

Another significant things Tech Writing does are Improvements to [DX](/practices/good-developer-experience) and Improvements to Developer Acquisition. A good tool - if it is API, [SDK](practices/software-development-kit), whole Dev Portal or a software product, needs to have documentation. You are building a relationship with developer through how easy is to use your *XYZ*.

## How to Implement Technical Writing 

Best way is to have someone interested in technical writing in your team, preferably a skilled techwriter. But not all teams have the resources for it (and for UX team and others).

So, If you don't have a technical writer in your team, you should want to start understanding the field more. **Start with documentating your work**. Imagine you have fresh start (you can always relive the memories by doing something completely different than you do normal. Switching tech stacks doesn't fully count, since you have general information about coding.). What do you need now?

**Start writing about the first steps with A**. Guides, tutorials, or How-to's give enough to play. Look into writing resources, Google has free technical writing course. Look into tools that could make your life easier. Automate. **Use Style Guide**s, like [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/), [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html) or the [University of Oxford Style Guide](https://www.ox.ac.uk/sites/files/oxford/media_wysiwyg/University%20of%20Oxford%20Style%20Guide.pdf), [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style) or [English Style Guide - European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/styleguide_english_dgt_en.pdf). 

You want to be clear in your writing. To avoid friction, consider switching to [Simplified Technical English](http://www.asd-ste100.org/). Play with the language, watch your information.

After writing first steps, **look into your code.** Yes, a good code should be clear enough to have almost none documentation. But there is stuff you won't express only in code. Comments can make your short function into long beast. Consider moving them outside of the code. *Why does A returns B? What is the logic of this function. Usercode - what is this variable?*  Is your API understanable outside your dev circle? 

While at it, you can thnk about information. How do you make sense of things? What helps you to understand? Reading about it and trying will make you think about your design. Is this understandable? How can I communicate better. Is this the best way to say it?


## Common Pitfalls of Technical Writing 

- Not enough tech writers.
- It can be hard to explain why good information sharing is important.
- Developers are asked to document. They usually don't like it and its wasting their time.
- Tech writer wasn't given a time to understand the context. 
- The Curse of knowledge - writer already expects information for granted.
