# KISS

**TL;DR**

KISS is a design principle reminding you to stop overcomplicating work. It is better to keep things simple. However, achieving smart simplicity is hard on all fronts.

## What Is KISS

KISS is a principle standing for **K**eep **I**t **S**imple, **S**tupid (sometimes written as *Keep it stupid simple* or *Keep it simple and straightforward*). Broadly, it tells you that things are better when they are simpler. Some designers use KISS as their central design goal. Simple things are more accessible, usually easier to use and have a flatter learning curve.

The phrase originally comes from the Lockheed designer team and their head engineer Kelly Johnson (later founder of the Skunk Works). The idea behind KISS *is to get results cheaper sooner, and better through the application of common sense to tough problems. If it works, donâ€™t fix it.*

If you apply the KISS principle to developer work, you should aim to split your hard problems into smaller ones and then solve them with simple solutions. If you are designing architecture, break it into parts (microservices vs monolith) and **[refactor](/practices/refactoring)** (a lot!). Don't make your code do four things at once (at the same time). Believe us, you will thank yourself for solutions aiming at simplicity.

In terms of application to [Developer Experience](practices/good-developer-experience), Johnson mentions that you should *Reduce reports and other paperwork to a minimum* (use KISS for your [agile events](/practices/agile-events)) and in terms of [team culture](/practices/team-culture), he said *let managers run their programs with a minimum of interference. He not only gave you the authority but also the [responsibility](/practices/responsibility)*

## Why You Might Want KISS

It gets the job done (together with [SMART Goals](/practices/smart-goals)). Simpler, cleaner code (structure, database or architecture) is easier to maintain, less demotivating to work on or less painful to handover. Documentating, [updating dependencies](/practices/updating-the-dependencies) or even [portability](/practices/software-portability) is less demanding for cleaner stuff. KISS saves you a lot of pain (now and in the future).
