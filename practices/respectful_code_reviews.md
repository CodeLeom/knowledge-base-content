# Respectful Code Reviews

**TL;DR**

Respectful and constructive feedback is the basis of a fruitful collaboration, healthy work environment, and quality product.

## **How to Implement Respectful Code Reviews**

**Follow defined guidelines**

Define guidelines at the project or company level. Follow style guides and coding standard documents and use them as benchmarks for reviews. These guidelines should be available to all concerned for reference.

**Understand code and functionality before reviewing**.

Have a clear picture of the functionality before you start a review. Read related documentation. You can even ask for a code walkthrough. Clarify doubts, if any.

**Explain review comments**

Wherever possible, support your comments with an explanation. Suggestions and examples help the developer to understand the comments better. If you are suggesting alternate solutions highlight the advantages.

**Be respectful and clear**

Use clear and respectful language. The development and review process aims to improve the quality of the product hence make comments keeping the code as the main subject of the discussion.

**Appreciate good work during code review**

Recognize good work whenever you see it. Acknowledging good work boosts morale of the developer and lays the foundation for a healthy work environment.

 **Try to understand the intent of feedback**

As a developer, you should read the comments keeping in mind that review comments are quality checks for the code. They help to make the code and the product better.

 **Common Pitfalls**

-  Written communication makes it hard to understand the reasoning behind the comment especially if the developer and reviewer are not acquainted.
-  Comment discussion may take a longer time if comments are unclear.
-  Developers are biased towards their solution and may not be receptive to review comments.
