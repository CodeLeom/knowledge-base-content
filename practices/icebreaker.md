# Icebreaker

**TL;DR**

Icebreaker is an activity used at the beginning of a meeting to attendees more comfortable with each other, encouraging them to speak up, listen up, join in, and open up to new ideas.


## What Is an Icebreaker

An icebreaker is an activity or game designed to "break the ice" between attendees in a meeting. In general, it is used at the beginning of the session to introduce participants to each other, get them relaxed and energized for the upcoming activities. 

Icebreakers are unrestricted to the beginning of a meeting, neither to a random group of attendees. They work very well at the start, middle (after a break), and at the end of a session, and also work very well for attendees who are familiar with each other because they help to set a safe space for attendees to learn and share.

## Why You Might Want Use Icebreakers

Icebreakers are fun and remarkable ways to start meetings or training sessions. They are a versatile and adaptable tool used to make the attendees more comfortable with each other, encouraging them to speak up, listen up, join in, and open up to new ideas.

These activities foster networking and a sense of community due to the experience exchange. They can set the tone for the upcoming session and give participants ownership of the learning, with no pressure or high expectations.

## How to Implement Icebreakers?

One of the best places to find an icebreaker is online, but we must be careful because they usually are associated with adjectives that may not describe its essence.  When looking for an icebreaker, we must have in mind the goal we want to achieve, the time we can spend with it, and if it will help or not to achieve the goal.

Above, we present some examples of how to choose icebreakers aiming for a specific goal.

- If the goal is to introduce participants to each other so they can interact several times during the meeting, the chosen activity must focus on the individual presentation plus establish a bonding way between attendees. For example, by making them recognize and appreciate differences and similarities in each other.

- If the aim is to introduce the meeting topic, we may want a fun activity, or even something more casual and thoughtful. For example, something related to questions and answers that prepare people for the following experiences.

- If the main goal is to help a group to form a team, probably icebreakers that enforce teamwork, trust, and communication will be the best approach.

As already said, there is plenty of online sites teaching the most diverse activities, but if you are looking for a quick start, I would like to recommend the following ones as guidance for your journey on the icebreakers world.
