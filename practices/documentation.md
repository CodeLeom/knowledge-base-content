# Documentation

**TL;DR**

Every software should have documentation written for it. It helps users by providing instructions on how to use the software. Follow these guidelines to write good documentation.

## What Is Documentation

Documentation in a software project is a manual that describes the architecture of the software and provides helpful instructions to the users. These instructions include an installation guide, how to use the software, and also guides to resolve common issues users might experience while working with the software.

## Why You Might Want Documentation

Providing clear documentation is important because it saves a lot of time for the users, other developers in the team, and even sometimes for the developer who wrote the code. How?

- Users while using the software for the first time, might not know how to navigate within the software or achieve the intended functionality. Clear documentation comes in handy at these times.

- Documentation helps other developers or open source contributors(in case of open source project) who are working in the codebase to understand the code better and makes the development process faster and simpler.

- In case of a situation, where the developer took a break from the project for a brief period or when the codebase becomes larger, it might be hard for the developer to remember all the details without the help of documentation.

## Problems Documentation Helps to Solve

- [Long feedback loops](/problems/long-feedback-loops)
- [Poor code quality](/problems/poor-code-quality)
- Less user support

## How to Implement Documentation

- Use tools such as [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) or [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) to create documentation websites faster.

- You can also create documentation websites with your preferred tech stack.

- Documentation should be clear and concise and must be written in a way that is understandable by all types of users.

## Common Pitfalls of Documentation

- Outdated documentation - Not updating the documentation when you change the underlying functionality, leads to more confusion than having no documentation.

- Unclear documentation - Documentation that is not providing clear instructions serves less purpose. 

- Unusual layout - All Documentations follow a similar layout. So, using an unusual layout makes it hard for the users to navigate through the documentation.

- Improper Hierarchy - Either in HTML or markdown format not following heading hierarchy makes it difficult for the user to skim through or locate a specific section within a documentation page.
