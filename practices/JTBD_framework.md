# Jobs to Be Done
**TL;DR** Jobs to be done (JTBD from now on) is a theoretical framework that helps you understand the motivations and constraints of your customers. With JTBD you can build better products, improve your service, and create value for your customers.

## What is JTBD?
Jobs to be Done is a framework using which you can create more value for your customers. A Job in this context is a process that a person undertakes when they improve themselves. A Job to be done have constraints that are working against the change. On the other hand, Actions are solutions for your Jobs.

Your product is a _tool_ that Customer hires to get their Job done. Through this hire, the person evolves and has more potential for new Jobs. 

Summarised, your role in the Job is to: 
-  Understand your Customer
-  Identify a Job (not Activity)
-  Understand contrast and competition (The carp pâté can be a competitor of the wine bottle)
-  Allow Customers to hire your product
-  Let your Customer change themselves
-  See that your Customer stops using other products but yours
-  Thus create unique value for your Customer

JTBD has a different point of view for demand. Through this view, you look at how demand is created (push and pull) and how demand is reduced (anxiety and habits). 
- **Push** is what makes people change
	- *Internal* is when a person doesn’t like the current state of things
	- *External* is when a person’s life change due to external factors
- **Pull** is what shapes the change
	- *The pull for a better life* is motivation saying people want a better life
	- *The pull toward a solution* is what makes a person select one product as the mean for change.
- **Anxiety** are questions about the product
	- *Anxiety-in-choice* is being unsure if the products can deliver change
	- *Anxiety-in-use* is knowing that the product delivers the change. However, the product makes the person nervous about its qualities
- **Habits** are forces working against pulls
	- *Habits-in-choice* are externalities that are working against the switch to your product
	- *Habits-in-use* is learned “solutions” for the Job (person’s habits) 


## Why You Might Want JTBD?

JTBD is one of the possible idea/product validations frameworks you can use. With JTBD, you are actively listening to your customers’ Jobs and learning about their emotions, constraints, or motivations.

_When you see customers piecing together solutions themselves, these are great clues for innovation._

Through studying your Customers you can create products that answer their motivations and make the change easy for them.

## How to Implement JTBD?

Good starting points can be the Job Stories exercise and Customer Interviews.
### [Job Stories](https://jtbd.info/replacing-the-user-story-with-the-job-story-af7cdee10c27) exercise
This exercise aims to see your JTBD. Through writing Job Stories, you understand where you could create value. 
Start with this template sentence.

##### When _____ , I want to _____ , so I can _____.

Here, you don’t care about roles and expectations, since they are additional layers of assumptions. Don’t use personas, talk with Customers (in this case, it can be you).

__When__ depicts the situation. It can be simple (_When I wake up_) or complex (_When I am rewriting code because there is the new version of Python 4.6 and I can make it simpler_).

**I want to** is **Motivation**. Again, it can be one word (_the bathroom_) or full sentence (_I want to find a way to make this automatically_). Add **Forces** to this part. These are things that providing additional context (_I am angry when I need to go through monolith of code and check each function manually_) Forces can help you with designing your solution (product for hire). 

**So, I can** is the Expected Outcome. For example, *So, I can focus more on creating value*.

When you have your sentence filled, start thinking about why do you want X. Start rewriting or re-editing. Look at the motivations you have. Understand the Forces and use them to your advantage to achieve your Expected Outcome. Ask what is next?

Then, you can start designing your solution around the job. 

The best way to use this exercise is to do it after the Customer Interview with your customer’s stories. 

### Customer Interview

A Customer Interview is a method to understand *WHY*. You are  analysing the “customer journey” of people who **bought** your product. This is not about *WHY* your product is good, its about *WHY* they bought it.

Remember that, your customers generally don’t analyse why did they buy something. You are learning with them about them. The point is to build the *Story* and its *essence*. 

The interview starts with understanding the point of purchase, then continue towards first thoughts about the product, and start unrevealing the story between these two points. Consider the following questions.

- **Point of Purchase**
	- When did you purchase the product?
	- Where did you purchase X?
	- What time was it?
	- How did you purchase it?
	- How was the weather?
	- Did you buy something with it?

Usually, it’s not a good idea to ask why did you make the purchase. Don’t make them question their purchase, make them remember the feelings alongside it.
- **First thoughts**
	- When did you first time realise that you “need”
	- Where were you?
	- Were you with someone?
	- What were you doing? What were you trying to do?

- **Story Building**
	- How frequently did you try to do the thing?
	- Where were you looking?
	- How did you start with your search?
	- What were your searching habits?
	- Do you have a history with X?
	- Did you look at X? 
	- What was important for you during that time?
	- What were the factors for you? 
	- What solutions did you try? Or did not try? Why?
	- How did your close ones feel about it?
	- Did you talk about the purchase with your close ones?
	- Did you imagine before the purchase what using X would be like?
	- What were you hoping for?

Engage in their memories, explore their emotions, and build rapport with them to identify Pulls, Pushes, Anxieties, and Habits.

## Common Pitfalls of JTBD
- Focus on Actions rather than on Job
- Misunderstanding who is your competitor
- Not working around Anxieties and Habits of your customers
- Not enough practical information online about JTBD
- Rushed Interviews without understanding the story
- Talking about your product then customer experience
